## Initial setup

```{r required packages, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
require(dplyr)
require(tidyr)
require(ggplot2)
require(xtables)
require(data.table)
```

## Loading and preprocessing the data
Since I am using a static file, downloaded once I am not including downloading the file step.  
I use the data table package since running in tables is faster than running as data frames.
```{r read table}
DT <- read.table("activity.csv", sep = ",", header = TRUE)
glimpse(DT)



## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
